# Movie-Recommendation-System
This is a Movie Recommendation System project. The Movie Recommendation System project aims to develop a machine learning model that provides personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and viewing history. This system will leverage collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to predict and suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy.

Objectives:
Develop a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their past interactions and preferences.
Implement and compare different recommendation algorithms to identify the most effective approach.
Evaluate the system's performance using relevant metrics and improve its accuracy and user satisfaction.
